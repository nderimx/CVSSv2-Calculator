# CVSSv2-Calculator

### A CVSS calculator for scoring vulnerabilities using json files as input.
I wrote this program for automating my security research using "A Complete Guide to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2.0" as the specification.
I also used the scored CVE examples as test cases, to make sure it works as intended by the authors.
